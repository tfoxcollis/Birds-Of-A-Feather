# Birds of a Feather - LV

## Overview:

Birds of a Feather is a project that is near and dear to my heart.  It's an app geared towards LGBTQ+ families in the Las Vegas area looking to connect and set up play dates with their kids.  The user has the ability to view events by zip code, RSVP to events, and add their own events.

## Challenges:
- Using the Mapquest API was a bit of a stretch for me and I had to really dig into it to understand it
- Thinking of sad paths for testing
- Utilizing a modal had a bit of a learning curve as well

## Wins:
- Getting the Map to pinpoint spots in the Las Vegas area was difficult but so fun!
- The Modal and Maps 
- Getting the buttons to be a bit more interactive


## Future Additions:
- Backend build out to allow users to sign in
- Stronger relationship between objects in a database
- A "My Events" page so the user can see the events they created
- Messaging feature for communication between the users
